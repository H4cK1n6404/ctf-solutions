# noxCTF 2018: Python SandBox Problems
__Tags:__ `misc`, `python-sandbox`

## Problems

### Python for Fun 1 and 2

Your input goes into this code

```python
def fun(<your input here>):
    c = a + b
    return c
```

Challenge 2 is a bit more restrictive where your not allowed `open`, `__import__`, etc.

### Smooth Snake

The latter part of the problem you connect to `nc 18.223.150.0 674`

You have to get the flag and you are not allowed the following characters: `._'\:`

As well as other keywords for example:
- `open`
- `replace`
- `os`
